        The objective of this project is to create a Restaurant Billing System app. Restaurant Billing 
        System app consists of three pages namely Main Page, Billing Page and the Final Page. Main 
        Page consists of menu of the food along with its prices. It is created by using .net MAUI App. 
        Main page contains a display for the individual prices when clicked. A button to navigate to 
        billing page with name Bill. You can add a food item several times and delete the items. 
        Billing Page implements MVVM to display the bill. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Billing page contains a cancel button that 
        restarts the app and clears the Billing Page. After the order is placed you will be navigated to 
        the final Page with calculated total price and the order number. The Final Page consists of a 
        button new Customer and Print Bill Button which prints the final bill. The new customer 
        button restarts the app for the new customer and the process starts again. The final bill will 
        be stored in a database for future references. There will be a page for calculating total 
        earnings at the end of the day which also clears the data base.
