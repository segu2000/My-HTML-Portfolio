<!-- <h3>What to bring:</h3> -->
 <p>
  The objective of this project is to reduce the work load for the farmers by making some of the farming works simple. The scope of this project is that, this can be used in several farms depending on the type of crop without limitations, solar panels can be introduced for continuous supply of power to the electronic device, i.e. Arduino. The whole IOT ecosystem is made up of sensors that can detect real-time conditions like humidity, heat index, moisture, temperature more accurately. These sensors monitor the condition of the crops. If any disturbing conditions are found, then an alert is send. What gets eliminated is the partial need in the physical presence of a farmer which also eventually increases the productivity and help farmers to reap more agriculture benefits. Nowadays, the count of farmers is reducing and the demand for man power is increasing drastically, to help them to some extent we are introducing smart agricultural system along with automation using IoT(Internet of Things). The project is designed in such a way that the data collected through the sensors is used to perform actions by the live visibility from Blynk application.

 <h3>Advantages:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Live monitoring of crop health with automation of motor and controlling the actions of water level using soil moisture values through an application.</li>
  <li>Smart light monitoring which adds more convenience for the farmers at night.</li>
  <li>Overflow prevention of water at the time of any bad situations like sensor failure, heavy rain etc.</li>
  <li>Heat index values can be utilized to protect the agricultural land from fire accidents.</li>
</ul>
